Introduction
------------

This is the documentation for the FluxCompensator, an open-source post-processing tool of continuum radiative transfer codes. It is capable of producing "realistic" synthetic observations from the output of radiative transfer codes such as `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_. The FluxCompensator (as `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_) can be accessed via Python scripts. However, little knowledge of Python is required as we provide pre-constructed pipelines and interfaces.

Compatibility with Other Codes
------------------------------

The FluxCompensator package has been designed to be able to post-process the radiative transfer output of `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_. It follows the same philosophy as `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_ in using object-oriented Python scripts and making it therefore more user friendly and generic. Very little Python knowledge is required to work with either `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_ or the FluxCompensator. As the tool has been designed for `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_, some features of the FluxCompensator will only work optimally if `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_ inputs are used. 
However, in principle it should be easy to adapt the FluxCompensator so that it can read in any arbitrary ideal observations from other radiative transfer codes, provided that they can output a spectral cube. Aside from the input, most of the code is not specific to `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_. For assistance with other radiative transfer outputs contact as `here <koepferl@usm.lmu.de>`__.
